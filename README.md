# Pluralsight // .NET Microservices

Personal repository for following along with the ".NET Microservices" learning path offered by *Pluralsight*. (https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/net-microservices)

*Microservices are a design pattern in which applications are composed of small, independent modules that communicate with each other using well-defined contracts making it easier to develop, test, and deploy isolated parts of your application. This path is designed for the .NET developer wanting to learn more about these small, modular, and independently deployable services taking their skills to the next level!*
